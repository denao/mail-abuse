mail-abuse
==========

Basic open relay test script 

You can configure a set of tests on a config file and it will reproduce these tests on your server.

This is a very old script (2002) which tries to reproduce the Relay tests made by cygnus.mail-abuse.org.
It is probably very outdated and it needs maintenance, although it works fine :)

I just added this script to a repository now based on requests.

Feel free to use and abuse, and drop me a line if you have any questions or suggestions.

Best
